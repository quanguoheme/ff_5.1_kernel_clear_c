menuconfig MAILBOX
	bool "Mailbox Hardware Support"
	help
	  Mailbox is a framework to control hardware communication between
	  on-chip processors through queued messages and interrupt driven
	  signals. Say Y if your platform supports hardware mailboxes.

if MAILBOX
config PL320_MBOX
	bool "ARM PL320 Mailbox"
	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  An implementation of the ARM PL320 Interprocessor Communication
	  Mailbox (IPCM), tailored for the Calxeda Highbank. It is used to
	  send short messages between Highbank's A9 cores and the EnergyCore
	  Management Engine, primarily for cpufreq. Say Y here if you want
	  to use the PL320 IPCM support.

config ROCKCHIP_MAILBOX
	bool "Rockchip Soc Intergrated Mailbox Support"
	depends on ARCH_ROCKCHIP
	help
	  This driver provides support for inter-processor communication
	  between CPU cores and MCU processor on Some Rockchip SOCs.
	  Please check it that the Soc you use have Mailbox hardware.
		Say Y here if you want to use the Rockchip Mailbox support.

config SCPI_PROTOCOL
        bool "ARM System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol"
        select ROCKCHIP_MBOX
        help
          System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol is
          defined for the purpose of communication between the Application
          Cores(AP) and the System Control Processor(SCP). The mailbox
          provides a mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP
          and AP.

          This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
          making use of the features offered by the SCP.
